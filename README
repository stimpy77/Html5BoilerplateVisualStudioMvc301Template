EDIT: Guys, this is stale, years old. Don't use it unless you want to use 2011's idea of an HTML 5 Boilerplate template in Visual Studio 2010 for MVC 3

____

This template is free for the taking and usage and is a modified (for Visual Studio / ASP.NET MVC 3.01) version 
of html5boilerplate.com's v1.0 "clean" download. Refer to that package for detailed license info.
