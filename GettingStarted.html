    <h1>Welcome to the HTML 5 Boilerplated Optimized ASP.NET MVC 3.01 Web App (clean)</h1>
    <img src="Content/Images/apple-touch-icon-114x114-precomposed.png"  
        style="height: 260px; width: 242px; float: right; margin-left: 5px;" />

    <p>This Visual Studio project is based upon the clean HTML 5 boilerplate solution found at 
        <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">http://html5boilerplate.com</a>. 
		This is not the first html5boilerplate.com based Visual 
        Studio 2010 template to be produced, but as of this initial submission the other 
        solutions focus on OpenID support rather than solely on purity and automated 
        optimization. Other features such as OpenID can be added from NuGet, etc.</p>
    <p>A few changes were made to the html5boilerplate.com solution in producing this template
		in order to make this as clean and pragmatic for a .NET developer 
        as possible. As html5boilerplate.com&#39;s solution utilizes Java-based tools for 
        optimization, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ant</li>
        <li>YUI Compressor</li>
        <li>et al</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        ... this implementation instead uses a post-build batch file (see 
        post-build.bat) and Microsoft&#39;s Ajax Minifier which is included in the Tools 
        directory. Should you choose to instead revert back to YUI Compressor or some 
        other minifier tool (I might recommend Google Closure Compiler instead) you can 
        feel free to modify the post-build.bat file to suit your preferences, including 
        perhaps downloading and adding the html5boilerplate.com tools directory with its 
        ant build.xml script, but of course any changes to the post-build script will 
        require that you set up all dependencies and environment configurations as 
        needed.</p>
    <p>
        Some key things to point out:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Observe Scripts/app.js. This should be your application client-side script file. 
            If you want to rename this file, or if you wish to add additional application 
            logic scripts, you should update the post-build.bat file to reflect the file 
            changes.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Take a look at Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml, which acquired the bulk of 
            html5boilerplate.com&#39;s index.html markup (plus added ASP.NET MVC 3 Razor 
            semantics).
            <ul>
                <li>Note the Razor view sections that are rendered and where.</li>
                <li>Note also the scripts section placeholder for page-specific scripts not handled 
                    in the app.js file.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Take a look at Views/Home/Index.cshtml. 
            <ul>
                <li>Note the Razor view sections that are populated. Execute the site to see how 
                    this sample page is laid out with Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.</li>
                <li>Note also the scripts section implementation for page-specific scripts not 
                    handled in the app.js file.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
		<li>Due to the absence of proper documentation on how to use IVsPackageInstaller to invoke 
			NuGet to install the MVC 3 Refresh dependency packages, you will need to install these 
			packages manually if you wish them to be NuGet-managed. 
			<ul>
				<li>jQuery v1.5.1</li>
				<li>jQuery.vsdoc v1.5.1</li>
				<li>jQuery.Validation v1.8.0</li>
				<li>jQuery.UI.Combined v1.8.11</li>
				<li>EntityFramework v4.1.10331.0</li>
				<li>Modernizr v1.7</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Entity Framework 4.1 is not 
			referenced at all, so you will have to manually NuGet-install that no 
			matter what if you intend to 
			use it.</li>
        <li>The <strong>post-build.bat</strong> file optimizes these files by default and/or deletes the 
            optimized versions:<ul>
                <li><strong>Content/html5boilerplate-site.css</strong><ul>
                    <li>This file originated as html5boilerplate.com&#39;s css/style.css</li>
                    <li>The optimized flavor of this file becomes <strong>
                        Content/html5boilerplate-site.min.css</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Content/html5boilerplate-handheld.css</strong><ul>
                    <li>This file originated as html5boilerplate.com&#39;s css/handheld.css</li>
                    <li>The optimized flavor of this file becomes <strong>
                        Content/html5boilerplate-handheld.min.css</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Content/style.css</strong><ul>
                    <li>This is a clean .css file for your site that is loaded after the 
                        html5boilerplate reset scripts</li>
                    <li>The optimized flavor of this file becomes <strong>Content/style.min.css</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scripts/app.js</strong><ul>
                    <li>This should contain your client-side application logic</li>
                    <li>The optimized flavor of this file becomes <strong>Scripts/app.min.js</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scripts/app-plugins.js</strong><ul>
                    <li>This file originated as html5boilerplate.com&#39;s js/plugins.js</li>
                    <li>The optimized flavor of this file becomes <strong>Scripts/app-plugins.min.js</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>All .png files located at <strong>Content/Images/*.png</strong><ul>
                    <li>with optimized versions copied 
                    to <strong>Content/Images/optimized/*.png</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The post-build.bat optimizations of .js and .css files are, by default, 
            performed using <strong>Tools/AjaxMin.exe</strong> (Microsoft Ajax Minifier).</li>
        <li>The post-build.bat optimizations of .png files are performed using 
            <strong>Tools/optipng.exe</strong></li>
        <li><strong>The default .css and .js files that are optimized are </strong> <em>
            <strong>not</strong></em><strong> optimized 
            while debugging locally</strong>, and this is by design.<ul>
                <li>The optimized files are always generated. However,</li>
                <li>web.config defines an application setting called UseMinifiedResources which is 
                    false by default and set to true via web.Debug.config and web.Release.config 
                    transformations during site packing and/or deployment, and</li>
                <li>web.Debug.config transformations do not occur while debugging locally with F5 
                    debugging.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, one would not want to debug optimized files in the first place!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Alright, so have fun, and good luck.</p>
